### Pitfalls of `dynamic` ðŸš¨

1.  **Loss of Compile-Time Safety**: This is the biggest issue. Typos in property names (`user.Nmae` instead of `user.Name`) or unexpected changes in the data structure will only be discovered when the code runs, often causing your application to crash in production.

2.  **No IntelliSense**: Because the compiler doesn't know the object's type, your code editor can't provide autocompletion or suggestions. This slows down development and makes it easier to introduce typos.

3.  **Performance Overhead**: The `dynamic` keyword relies on the Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR) to resolve types and members at runtime. This adds a small but measurable performance cost compared to statically-typed code.
