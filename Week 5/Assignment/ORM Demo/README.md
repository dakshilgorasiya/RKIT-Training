# Comparison of EF Core, Dapper, ADO.NET

* **Raw ADO.NET:** The low-level foundation. It's the "engine" that everything else uses. You write all the code to open connections, create commands, and manually map results to objects. It's the fastest but also the most complex and error-prone.
* **Dapper:** A lightweight "micro-ORM." It excels at one thing: executing your raw SQL queries and mapping the results to C# objects (POCOs) extremely fast. It's the perfect middle ground, giving you the speed of ADO.NET without the boilerplate.
* **EF Core (Entity Framework Core):** A full-featured "ORM" (Object-Relational Mapper). It abstracts the database away. You work with C# objects and LINQ queries, and EF Core generates the SQL for you. It's focused on **developer productivity** and includes features like change tracking and database migrations.

| Feature | Raw ADO.NET | Dapper | EF Core (Entity Framework Core) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Performance** |  **Fastest** (Baseline) |  **Extremely Fast** (Near-native) |  **Fast** (Overhead from abstraction) |
| **Maintainability** |  **Low** |  **High** (If you know SQL) |  **Very High** (For CRUD) |
| **Security** | Fully manual | Very secure by design | Most secure by default
| **Query Language** | SQL | SQL | LINQ (or SQL) |
| **Change Tracking** | No (Manual) | No (Manual) | Yes (Automatic via `SaveChanges()`) |
| **Database Migrations** | No (Manual) | No (Manual) | Yes (Code-first schema management) |

### Detailed Breakdown


### 1. Raw ADO.NET

This is the foundational data access layer in .NET. Both Dapper and EF Core use ADO.NET under the hood. You use classes like `SqlConnection`, `SqlCommand`, and `SqlDataReader`.

* **Pros:**
    * **Maximum Performance:** You have direct, bare-metal control. Nothing is faster than well-written ADO.NET.
    * **Total Control:** You can use any advanced, database-specific feature without worrying if the ORM supports it.
* **Cons:**
    * **Huge Amount of Boilerplate:** You must manually write code to open/close connections, create commands, add parameters, loop through `SqlDataReader`, and map each column to an object's property.
    * **Error-Prone:** It's easy to forget to close a connection, make a mapping error, or (most dangerously) write code that is vulnerable to SQL injection if you're not careful with parameterization.
    * **Low Productivity:** It's very time-consuming to write and maintain.

### 2. Dapper

Dapper is a "micro-ORM". It is not a full-scale ORM; it's more accurately an "object mapper."

* **Pros:**
    * **Blazing-Fast Performance:** It is often considered the fastest object mapper in .NET, with performance almost identical to raw ADO.NET.
    * **Eliminates Boilerplate:** It handles all the tedious work of opening connections, managing commands, and mapping results to your C# objects.
    * **Full SQL Control:** You write the SQL, so you have complete control over query optimization.
    * **Lightweight:** It's a tiny library with no dependencies.
    * **Security:** It's design naturally encourages to use parameterized queries. 
* **Cons:**
    * **No Change Tracking:** Dapper doesn't know if an object has changed. You must write your own `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements.
    * **No Database Migrations:** Dapper doesn't help you manage or evolve your database schema.

### 3. EF Core (Entity Framework Core)

EF Core is Microsoft's official, full-featured ORM. It's designed to maximize developer productivity by creating an object-oriented model of your database.

* **Pros:**
    * **Highest Productivity:** You write queries in C# using LINQ. For simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, it's incredibly fast to develop.
    * **Change Tracking:** This is its killer feature. You fetch an object, modify its properties, and call `DbContext.SaveChanges()`. EF Core automatically detects the changes and generates the correct `UPDATE` statement.
    * **Database Migrations:** You can define your database schema using C# classes ("Code-First"). When you change a class (e.g., add a new property), EF Core can automatically generate the SQL script to update your database schema.
    * **Security:** EF Core always translates LINQ into parameterized queries, separating the command logic from the user-supplied data.
* **Cons:**
    * **Performance Overhead:** All that abstraction (LINQ translation, change tracking) adds overhead. While EF Core has become much faster, it will nearly always be slower than Dapper or ADO.NET for complex queries.
    * **Less Control:** The generated SQL can sometimes be hard to predict or optimize.

### ðŸ’¡ When to Use Which? (The "Right Tool for the Job")

* **Use Raw ADO.NET when...**
    * You have *one specific, performance-critical* operation (e.g., a bulk-update stored procedure) where even the minimal overhead of Dapper is too much.

* **Use Dapper when...**
    * **Performance is the top priority**, but you don't want to write ADO.NET boilerplate.
    * You are building **read-heavy applications** (like dashboards or reports).
    * You are working with a pre-existing, complex database (especially one with many stored procedures).

* **Use EF Core when...**
    * **Developer productivity is the top priority.**
    * You are building a standard **business/CRUD application** (e.g., internal tools, web APIs).
    * You are starting a **new project ("Code-First")** and want your code to be the source of truth for the database schema (using Migrations).
    * Your object model is complex, and you benefit from change tracking and relationship management.
